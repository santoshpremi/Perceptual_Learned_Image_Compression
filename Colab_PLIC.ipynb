        "With most of the internet traffic being image or (esp.) video data, image compression algorithms\n",
        "are essential to being able to handle this large amount of data. Neural Image Compression (NIC)\n",
        "methods have been shown to achieve significantly better compression rates compared to\n",

        "high quality, even if the actual pixel-values might differ from the original image.\n",

        "Design and implement a NIC method based on a SOTA method\n",
